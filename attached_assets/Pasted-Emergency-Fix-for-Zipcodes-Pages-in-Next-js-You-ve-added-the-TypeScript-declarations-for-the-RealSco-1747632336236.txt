Emergency Fix for Zipcodes Pages in Next.js
You've added the TypeScript declarations for the RealScout components, but you're still facing the Link component error in your zipcodes pages. This is a separate issue that needs to be addressed.
Option 1: Switch to Server-Side Rendering (Quickest Solution)
Modify your next.config.js to use server-side rendering instead of static generation:
javascript/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',  // This switches from static export to SSR
  typescript: {
    // Optional: only add this if you still have TypeScript errors
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  eslint: {
    // Optional: only add this if you still have ESLint errors
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
This is the fastest way to get your site deployed without having to fix the Link components in the zipcodes pages.
Option 2: Temporarily Replace Zipcodes Pages
If Option 1 doesn't work, create simplified versions of your zipcodes pages:

In /pages/zipcodes/index.tsx, replace everything with:

tsximport React from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function ZipcodesPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Las Vegas Zipcodes | Sun City Summerlin</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>Las Vegas Zipcodes</h1>
      <p>We're updating our zipcodes search. Please check back soon.</p>
      <Link href="/">Return to Home</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

In /pages/zipcodes/[zipcode].tsx, replace everything with:

tsximport React from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function ZipcodePage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { zipcode } = router.query;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Zipcode {zipcode} | Sun City Summerlin</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>Zipcode: {zipcode}</h1>
      <p>We're updating our zipcode information. Please check back soon.</p>
      <Link href="/zipcodes">Back to All Zipcodes</Link>
    </div>
  );
}

// Add this to provide paths for static generation
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [],
    fallback: 'blocking'
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {}
  };
}
Option 3: Fix the Link Component Issue
If you want to preserve your current zipcodes pages, the specific issue is with how you're using the Link component. Open your zipcodes pages and check for:

Old style Link usage with <a> tag children:
jsx<Link href="/some-path">
  <a className="some-class">Link text</a>
</Link>

Replace with new style (for Next.js 13+):
jsx<Link href="/some-path" className="some-class">
  Link text
</Link>


I recommend trying Option 1 first, as it's the quickest way to get your site deployed without having to modify your content.
