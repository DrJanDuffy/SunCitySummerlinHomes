In your code, you have <Link> components with <a> tags as children, which is not allowed in the newer versions of Next.js. For example, you might have something like:
jsx<Link href="/home">
  <a className="nav-link">Home</a>
</Link>
How to Fix It
There are two ways to fix this:
Option 1: Remove the inner <a> tag (Recommended)
The modern way (for Next.js 13+) is to remove the inner <a> tag and put attributes directly on the Link component:
jsx// Change this:
<Link href="/home">
  <a className="nav-link">Home</a>
</Link>

// To this:
<Link href="/home" className="nav-link">
  Home
</Link>
Option 2: Use legacyBehavior prop
If you have many links and want a quicker fix, you can keep your nested <a> tags by adding the legacyBehavior prop:
jsx<Link href="/home" legacyBehavior>
  <a className="nav-link">Home</a>
</Link>
Finding and Fixing All Instances
You'll need to search through your codebase for all instances of <Link> components with <a> children and update them. Common locations include:

Navigation components
Headers
Footers
Menu items
Sidebar components

Additional Issues in Your Log
Your log also shows these other issues:

Script tag warning:
Do not add <script> tags using next/head (see inline <script>). Use next/script instead.
Fix: Replace <script> tags in your <Head> component with the <Script> component from Next.js:
jsximport Script from 'next/script';

// Use like this:
<Script src="your-script.js" strategy="afterInteractive" />

Missing unique keys in lists:
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Fix: Add unique key props to list items in your Head component.
Missing image files:
GET /shopping-plaza.jpg 500 in 5200ms
GET /golf-cart-path.jpg 500 in 5304ms
GET /google-logo.png 500 in 5188ms
Fix: Make sure these image files exist in your public directory or update the paths.
Webpack caching error:
This is likely a permissions issue in your Replit environment and generally doesn't prevent your app from working.

Step-by-Step Approach

First, fix all Link components - this is preventing your app from rendering
Then address the script tag issue
Fix the missing key props
Finally, fix the image paths
