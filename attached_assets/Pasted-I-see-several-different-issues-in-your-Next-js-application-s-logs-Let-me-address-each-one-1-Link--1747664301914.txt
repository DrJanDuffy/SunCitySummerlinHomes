I see several different issues in your Next.js application's logs. Let me address each one:
1. Link Component Error (Fixed)
It looks like your previous Link component error might be resolved since it's not appearing in these logs anymore.
2. Image Style Warning
Image with src /property1.jpg is assigned the following styles, which are overwritten by automatically-generated styles: width, height
This warning occurs when you're trying to apply inline width and height styles to a Next.js Image component, but these styles are being overridden by Next.js's own styles.
Fix:
jsx// Instead of this:
<Image src="/property1.jpg" style={{ width: '100px', height: '100px' }} />

// Do this:
<Image src="/property1.jpg" width={100} height={100} />
3. Failed to Fetch Error
TypeError: Failed to fetch
This error typically happens when:

Your API endpoint is unavailable
There's a network issue
CORS policies are blocking the request

Fix:

Check that any API endpoints your app is calling are accessible
If using local API routes, ensure they're properly set up
Add error handling for fetch requests:

jsxfetch('/api/your-endpoint')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Handle your data
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
    // Handle the error gracefully in the UI
  });
4. Fast Refresh Full Reload
warn - Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload
This happens when Next.js can't preserve state between edits. Common causes:

Editing a file outside the React tree
Changes to global CSS
Changes that affect React component hierarchy significantly

This is just a warning and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.
5. Experimental Feature Warning
warn - You have enabled experimental feature (optimizeCss) in next.config.js.
This is just a warning. If you need CSS optimization, you can keep this feature enabled, but be aware it might change in future Next.js releases.
Next Steps
Your application seems to be running but has some minor issues. Here's what I recommend:

Fix the Image component issue by using the proper Next.js Image props instead of style attributes
Investigate the fetch error:

Check browser console for more details
Verify API endpoints are working
Add proper error handling for fetch calls


Consider updating your next.config.js to use stable features instead of experimental ones if possible
