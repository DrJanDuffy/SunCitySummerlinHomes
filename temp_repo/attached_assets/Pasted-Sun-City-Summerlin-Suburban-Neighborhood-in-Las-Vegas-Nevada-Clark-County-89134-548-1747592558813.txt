Carting around in Sun City
Sun City Summerlin is a very walkable community, but another form of transportation is the golf cart. Several golf cart road signs warn drivers to be cautious of carts trekking between courses. "This is an active golf cart community," Branch says. "There's a designated golf cart pathway, plus many people drive their carts to the grocery store." But residents mainly drive motor vehicles when heading into town. If Downtown Vegas is where they're headed, they have a 12-mile trip eastbound on Highway 613. Summerlin Hospital is about 3 miles south of the community. The North Las Vegas Airport is about 7 miles away if locals need to catch a flight.
